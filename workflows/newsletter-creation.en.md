TRACK INDICATORS (48h after send):

OPEN RATE:
Formula: (Emails opened / Emails delivered) × 100

### Step 5: Continuous optimization

```
Improvement based on data:

MONTHLY ANALYSIS:

A/B TESTS (on part of list):
Test email subject:
- Version A: "5 electrical safety tips"
- Version B: "[First name], your safety checklist of the month"
→ Keep version with better open rate

Test CTA:
- Version A: "Learn more"
- Version B: "Book my free audit"
→ Keep version with more clicks

Test length:
- Version A: Short newsletter (300 words)
- Version B: Long newsletter (600 words)
→ Analyze engagement

EVOLUTIONS:
- If open rate ↘: Vary subjects, send times
- If CTR ↘: Improve CTA, more engaging images
- If unsubs ↑: Reduce frequency or review content relevance

COLLECT FEEDBACK:
Add mini-survey to newsletter (1 click):
"Was this newsletter useful?"
[😊 Yes] [😐 So-so] [😞 No]

## Troubleshooting

### Low open rate

**Cause**: Unattractive email subject
**Solution**: Proven formulas:

```
HIGH OPEN RATE SUBJECTS:

✓ Personalization: "[First name], your [benefit]"
✓ Curiosity: "The trend everyone is ignoring"
✓ Urgency (authentic): "Last days for [offer]"
✓ Question: "Did you know [surprising fact]?"
✓ Direct benefit: "Save $200 with this tip"

✗ Avoid:
- Spam words: "Free!!!", "URGENT", "Easy money"
- Too long (>50 characters)
- Generic: "January newsletter"
- All caps

Test: Send 10% of list with subject A, 10% with subject B
Measure open rate after 6h
Send rest of list with better subject
```

### Spam flagging

**Cause**: Bad sending practices
**Solution**: Strict compliance:

```
ANTI-SPAM RULES:

LEGAL (GDPR/CAN-SPAM):
✓ Opt-in consent (voluntarily checked box)
✓ Visible unsubscribe link (footer)
✓ Clear sender identity (no no-reply)
✓ Company postal address in footer

TECHNICAL:
✓ SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication (DNS)
✓ Balanced text/image ratio (not just images)
✓ Avoid too many links (max 3-5)
✓ No attachments (link to download)
✓ Test with Mail-Tester.com (score >8/10)

LIST HYGIENE:
✓ Clean bounce emails
✓ Remove inactive >2 years
✓ Double opt-in (email confirmation)
