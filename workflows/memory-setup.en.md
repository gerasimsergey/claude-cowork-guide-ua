# Set Up Persistent Memory

🌐 **Languages**: [English](memory-setup.en.md) | [Français](memory-setup.md)

> **Category**: Organization | **Difficulty**: Beginner | **Setup Time**: 15 min

---

## Goal

Stop repeating yourself. Without configuration, you re-explain your preferences, clients, and work habits at the start of every Cowork session. With a memory.md file and Desktop Commander, Cowork knows all of this automatically.

## Prerequisites

- Cowork active (Pro or Max subscription)
- Claude Desktop installed and up to date
- 15 minutes for initial setup

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Install Desktop Commander

Desktop Commander is the official extension that enables persistent memory.

1. In Claude Desktop, open the **Customize** tab (main navigation)
2. Find **Desktop Commander** in the extensions list
3. Click **Install**
4. Restart Claude Desktop when prompted

> See [Getting Started Step 8](../guide/01-getting-started.md#step-8-install-desktop-commander-recommended) for details.

### Step 2: Create memory.md

1. In Finder, navigate to `~/Cowork-Workspace/`
2. Create a new text file named `memory.md`
3. Open it with TextEdit or any text editor

### Step 3: Fill In Your Memory

Copy the template for your business type (see next section) and adapt it to your situation.

Start simple, 5-10 lines is enough to begin. You'll enrich it over time.

### Step 4: Test That It Works

Open a new Cowork session and type:

```
Read ~/Cowork-Workspace/memory.md and summarize what you know about my business.
```

If Cowork accurately describes your context, the setup worked.

### Step 5: Use It Every Session

From now on, start each conversation with:

```
Read ~/Cowork-Workspace/memory.md first. Then [your actual request]
```

## Usage Tips

**Start with 5-10 lines.** A short memory.md is better than a complex one you never keep up to date. Add information as you notice what you keep repeating session after session.

**Update regularly.** If a client preference changes, a supplier shifts, or your payment terms evolve, update the file. Outdated information in memory.md can cause errors.

**Share with a colleague if relevant.** If a partner or assistant also uses Cowork, a shared memory.md (same file, same workspace) keeps output consistent across sessions.

**Test monthly.** Once a month, ask Cowork to summarize what it knows about your business. This confirms the file is being read and reminds you what it contains.
