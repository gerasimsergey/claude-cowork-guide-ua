## Troubleshooting

### Document expired but renewal pending

**Cause**: Renewal applied but new certificate not yet received
**Solution**: Document pending status:

```
Workers' Comp Certificate expired 01/15/2026
Renewal application submitted 01/10/2026 (BEFORE expiration)

INTERIM DOCUMENTATION:
1. Copy of renewal application
2. Payment receipt/confirmation
3. Letter from insurance provider confirming continuous coverage
4. Expected certificate issue date: [Date]

Create "Gap Coverage Letter":
"Our Workers' Compensation insurance renewal is in process. Coverage remains
continuous per attached provider confirmation. Updated certificate will be
provided upon receipt (estimated [date])."

Attach to compliance package until official certificate received
```

### Requirement unclear or jurisdiction-specific

**Cause**: Ambiguous regulation or multiple interpretations
**Solution**: Research and document reasoning:

```
Question: Is [Specific Certification] required for [Activity]?

RESEARCH STEPS:
1. Check jurisdiction's official website ([Authority Name])
2. Review business code sections [Cite specific codes]
3. Call licensing authority for clarification (document date/person)
4. Consult industry association guidance

DOCUMENT FINDING:
- Requirement: YES / NO / DEPENDS ON [condition]
- Authority: [Source]
- Date verified: [Date]
- Contact: [Name/Phone if applicable]
- Notes: [Conditions, thresholds, exemptions]

Add to compliance notes with source for future reference/audits
```

### Client requires certification you don't have

**Cause**: Project-specific requirement beyond normal operations
**Solution**: Evaluate obtain vs. subcontract:

```
Client requires [EPA Lead-Safe Certification] for renovation project
Current status: Not certified

ANALYSIS:
Option A - Obtain Certification:
- Training: [Provider], [Duration], $XXX
- Exam: $XX
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks
- Ongoing: Renewal every [period]
- BENEFIT: Enables future similar projects

Option B - Subcontract/Partner:
- Find certified subcontractor for lead work
- Your scope: Non-lead components
- BENEFIT: No certification investment
- RISK: Dependence on subcontractor availability

RECOMMENDATION: [Option A/B] because [reasoning]

If Option A: Begin certification process immediately
If Option B: Identify 2-3 certified partners and establish agreements
```
