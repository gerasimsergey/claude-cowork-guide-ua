# Workflow: Daily Work Log

## Use Case

You need to document daily construction site activities with legal value. This workflow helps you:

- Create daily activity reports
- Document incidents and issues
- Maintain photo evidence
- Generate final completion report

> ⚠️ **Legal**: Work log serves as legal evidence in disputes - dates, photos, incidents are admissible in court.

### Step 3: Photo management

Organize evidence:

```
Photo documentation best practices:

PHOTO REQUIREMENTS:

1. TIMESTAMP:
- Use camera with auto date/time stamp
- OR use phone with EXIF data preserved
- Timestamp proves when photo taken (legal evidence)

2. NAMING CONVENTION:
Format: YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_description.jpg

Examples:
✓ 2026-01-20_0815_first-floor-overview.jpg
✓ 2026-01-20_1430_panel-relocated-after.jpg
✗ IMG_1234.jpg (unclear)
✗ photo.jpg (no context)

3. ORGANIZATION:
Folder structure:
~/Cowork-Workspace/projects/[project-name]/photos/
  /2026-01-20/
  /2026-01-21/
  /2026-01-22/

OR by category:
  /progress/
  /inspections/
  /issues/
  /before-after/

4. WHAT TO PHOTOGRAPH:

DAILY (minimum):
- Overall site condition (start of day)
- Work areas (before starting work)
- Work in progress
- Completed work
- Site condition (end of day)

SPECIFIC EVENTS:
- Inspections (inspector, passed/failed items)
- Incidents (damage, issues)
- Before/after (corrections, changes)
- Material deliveries (quantity, condition)
- Safety concerns
- Weather conditions (if impacting work)

WEEKLY:
- Panoramic site views (track overall progress)
- Each room/area from same angle (comparison over time)

5. PHOTO QUALITY:
- High resolution (not thumbnails)
- Well-lit (use flash if needed)
- Clear focus
- Include context (not just close-ups)
- Include measuring tape for scale when documenting issues

BACKUP STRATEGY:
- Primary: Phone/camera
- Backup 1: Cloud storage (Google Photos, iCloud) - auto-upload
- Backup 2: External hard drive (weekly)

Legal value: Timestamped photos can prove:
- Work actually performed on claimed dates
- Condition before/after repairs
- Compliance with inspections
- Timeline of events in disputes

Save protocol: ~/Cowork-Workspace/projects/[project-name]/photos/README-photo-protocol.txt

## Troubleshooting

### Forgetting daily entries

**Cause**: End-of-day rush, forgotten
**Solution**: Set routine and reminders:

```
DAILY LOG ROUTINE:

END OF DAY (15 minutes before crew leaves):
1. Take end-of-day site photos (5 min)
2. Fill out work log template (5 min)
   - Quick notes: tasks, crew, materials, issues
3. Save and backup (1 min)

Phone reminder: 4:30 PM daily "Log work for today"

Template pre-filled with:
- Project name
- Your name
- Standard crew names (just mark present/absent)

Requires only filling in variables:
- Tasks completed
- Materials used
- Issues (if any)

Total time: 5-10 minutes/day
```

### Photo overload (too many photos)

**Cause**: Taking too many, cluttered storage
**Solution**: Selective photography:

```
PHOTO GUIDELINES:

REQUIRED (minimum):
- Start of day site overview: 1 photo
- End of day site overview: 1 photo
- Each work area before work: 1 photo each
- Completed work areas: 1 photo each
- Inspections: 2-3 photos (inspector, pass/fail items)
- Incidents: 3-5 photos (angles, context)

TOTAL: ~10-20 photos/day for typical project

OPTIONAL (if time permits):
- Progress details
- Interesting techniques
- Client walk-through highlights

DELETE immediately:
- Blurry photos
- Duplicates
- Accidental photos

Weekly purge: Review photos, keep only relevant ones
```

### Lost or corrupted files

**Cause**: No backups, file corruption
**Solution**: 3-2-1 backup rule:

```
BACKUP STRATEGY:

3 copies: Original + 2 backups
2 different media: Phone + Computer + Cloud
1 off-site: Cloud storage

IMPLEMENTATION:

Primary: Phone photos + daily log on computer
Backup 1: Auto-sync phone to cloud (Google Photos/iCloud)
Backup 2: Weekly copy to external hard drive

Tools:
- Cloud: Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud (free tiers)
- External drive: $50-100 for 1TB
- Automatic sync: Set and forget

Recovery: If computer crashes, all files recoverable from cloud
```

---

## Variations

### Digital vs paper logs

```
PAPER LOGS:
Advantages:
- No battery/tech needed
- Quick on-site
- Sign-able (legal signature)

Disadvantages:
- Handwriting legibility
- Physical storage
- No digital backup

DIGITAL LOGS:
Advantages:
- Searchable
- Easy backup
- Photo integration
- Templates/automation

Disadvantages:
- Device needed
- Battery/connectivity
- Learning curve

HYBRID (RECOMMENDED):
- Quick notes on paper during day
- Transfer to digital at end of day (5-10 min)
- Scan paper copy → attach to digital log
- Best of both: quick capture + digital benefits
```

### Shared logs (multiple crew leads)

```
Multiple people logging:

STRUCTURE:
- Project Manager: Overall daily log
- Electrical lead: Electrical-specific log
- Plumbing lead: Plumbing-specific log

CONSOLIDATION:
PM reviews all logs end-of-day
Merges into master daily log
Keeps trade-specific logs as appendices

CLOUD COLLABORATION:
Shared folder: ~/Cowork-Workspace/projects/[name]/logs-shared/
Each person uploads their section
PM compiles final version

Tool: Google Drive with shared folder permissions
```

### Weekly/Monthly Progress Reporting

For longer projects (>2 weeks), create periodic progress reports:

```
Generate weekly progress report from work log [project name]:

PERIOD: Week of [start date] to [end date]

WORK COMPLETED THIS WEEK:
- [Summary of tasks with completion %]
- [Milestones achieved]

CREW:
- Total man-days: [X]
- Average crew size: [X people]

MATERIALS CONSUMED:
- [Key materials with quantities]
- [Approximate cost if needed]

OVERALL PROGRESS:
- Start of week: [X%]
- End of week: [Y%]
- Weekly gain: [+Z%]

SCHEDULE ADHERENCE:
- Original completion date: [date]
- Current forecast: [date]
- Variance: [± X days] → Reason: [brief explanation]

INCIDENTS/ALERTS:
- [Any issues affecting schedule/budget]
- [Corrective actions in progress]

NEXT WEEK FORECAST:
- [Planned work]
- [Expected deliveries]
- [Milestones to validate]

CLIENT NEEDS:
- [Decisions required]
- [Approvals needed]
- [Meetings to schedule]

Format: 2-page PDF max
Tone: Factual, reassuring, transparent
Recipient: Client / Project Owner
Save: ~/Cowork-Workspace/projects/[name]/reports/week-[number]-report.pdf
```

**Recommended frequency**:
- 2-4 week projects: Weekly report
- 1+ month projects: Weekly reports + monthly summary
- <2 week projects: Final report only

**Automated email delivery**:

```
Prepare email for weekly report:

Subject: [Project Name] - Week [number] Progress Report

Hello [Client],

Please find attached this week's progress report for your project.

Key points:
- Progress: [X%] (+[Y]% this week)
- Schedule: [On track OR [X] days delay due to [reason]]
- Next steps: [2-3 task summary]

Feel free to contact me with any questions.

Best regards,
[Signature]

Attachment: week-[number]-report.pdf
```

**Benefits of recurring reporting**:
- Client reassurance (continuous visibility)
- Avoid surprises (early alerts)
- Justify delays before they become problems
- Showcase progress (client sees value)
- Traceability (proof of rigorous tracking)

---

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency** — Log every single day, no exceptions
2. **Timeliness** — Log same day (memory fades quickly)
3. **Objectivity** — Factual descriptions, not opinions ("panel conflicts with cabinet" not "dumb design")
4. **Completeness** — All work, incidents, visitors documented
5. **Photos = Evidence** — Timestamped photos are your best legal protection
6. **Backup Always** — Lose logs = lose legal protection and project memory
7. **Client transparency** — Share weekly summaries, builds trust
8. **Archive post-project** — Keep logs 7+ years (statute of limitations for construction)
