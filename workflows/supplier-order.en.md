## Prerequisites

- [ ] Cowork enabled in Claude Desktop
- [ ] Current inventory or project needs list
- [ ] Supplier contact information and pricing
- [ ] Budget approval (if required)
- [ ] Workspace folder created

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Consolidate purchasing needs

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Cowork-Workspace/purchasing/{orders,deliveries,suppliers}
```

List requirements:

```
Purchasing needs consolidation for: [Week/Month/Project]

PERIOD: [Date range]
PURPOSE: [Ex: Weekly restock, Project materials, Seasonal prep]

NEEDS COLLECTION SOURCES:

1. INVENTORY ALERTS:
Review inventory system for items below minimum:
- Item A: 5 units (min: 15) → Need: 20 units
- Item B: 8 units (min: 10) → Need: 15 units

2. PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
Review project plans for upcoming materials:
- Johnson renovation: Needs tile, grout, adhesive (Week 4)
- Smith addition: Needs lumber, fasteners (Week 5)

3. FORECAST DEMAND:
Based on sales history:
- Paint (white): Avg 30 gal/month → Order 35 gal (buffer)
- 2×4 lumber: Avg 100 pcs/month → Order 120 pcs

4. OPPORTUNISTIC:
Supplier promotions/bulk discounts:
- Supplier X: 20% off paint this week → Stock up if using soon

CONSOLIDATED NEEDS LIST:

| Item | SKU | Qty Needed | Current Stock | Order Qty | Unit | Priority |
|------|-----|------------|---------------|-----------|------|----------|
| White paint | PAINT-042 | 35 | 10 | 40 | gal | High |
| Ceramic tile | TILE-030 | 200 | 50 | 200 | sq ft | High |
| 2×4 Studs | LUMBER-101 | 120 | 30 | 100 | pcs | Medium |
| Drywall screws | HW-015 | 500 | 200 | 500 | pcs | Medium |
| Grout | TILE-035 | 20 | 5 | 20 | bags | High |
| Paint rollers | TOOL-220 | 50 | 10 | 50 | units | Low |

PRIORITIZATION:
- High: Needed <1 week (project critical or stockout risk)
- Medium: Needed 1-2 weeks
- Low: Opportunistic or nice-to-have

|------|-----|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| White paint (gal) | 40 | $22/gal = $880 | $19/gal = $760 | $25/gal = $1000 | B ($760) |
| Ceramic tile (sq ft) | 200 | $4/sf = $800 | $3.60/sf = $720 | $5/sf = $1000 | B ($720) |
| 2×4 Studs (pcs) | 100 | $4.50 = $450 | $4.20 = $420 | Not carried | B ($420) |
| Drywall screws | 500 | $0.08 = $40 | $0.07 = $35 | $0.10 = $50 | B ($35) |
| Grout (bags) | 20 | $18 = $360 | $16 = $320 | $20 = $400 | B ($320) |
| Paint rollers | 50 | $3 = $150 | $2.50 = $125 | $4 = $200 | B ($125) |

TOTALS:
- Supplier A: $2,680
- Supplier B: $2,380 (11% cheaper)
- Supplier C: N/A (doesn't carry all items)

DELIVERY COSTS:
- Supplier A: Order >$1000 → Free delivery ✓
- Supplier B: Order $2,380 >$2000 → Free delivery ✓

DECISION FACTORS:

Option 1: All from Supplier B
- Total: $2,380 + $0 delivery = $2,380
- Lead time: 5-7 days
- Savings: $300 vs Supplier A
- Risk: May not have all in stock

Option 2: Split order (urgent from A, rest from B)
- Urgent items (tile, grout) from A: $1,160 + $75 delivery = $1,235 (arrives 2-3 days)
- Rest from B: $1,220 (arrives 5-7 days, free delivery)
- Total: $2,455
- Extra cost: $75 but gets critical items faster

Option 3: All from Supplier A (reliability)
- Total: $2,680
- Lead time: 2-3 days
- Premium: $300 for speed + reliability

RECOMMENDED DECISION:

For this order: Option 2 (split)
- Tile + grout urgent for Johnson project starting in 3 days
- Other items can wait
- Cost: $2,455 (only $75 more than cheapest option)
- Best balance of speed + cost

FUTURE OPTIMIZATION:
- If Supplier B consistently stocks items, switch more to them (save $300/order)
- If timing not critical, consolidate to B entirely
- Keep A for emergencies/rush orders

──────────────────────────────────────

RECOMMENDATIONS:

SUPPLIER A (ABC):
- Keep as primary supplier for critical items
- Set up auto-payment to never miss early discount
- Negotiate pricing: "Loyalty discount for 67% of our business?"

SUPPLIER B (XYZ):
- Use only for non-critical, bulk items where timing flexible
- Double-check orders (verify SKUs before accepting delivery)
- Consider reducing usage if reliability doesn't improve

NEW SUPPLIER EXPLORATION:
- Get quotes from 2 additional suppliers
- Test with small orders
- Compare: pricing, reliability, service

SUPPLIER DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY:
- Don't rely 100% on one supplier (risk if they have stockout)
- But don't spread too thin (lose volume discounts, relationship leverage)
- Target: 60% primary, 30% secondary, 10% specialty/backup

## Troubleshooting

### Delivery discrepancies (wrong items/quantities)

**Cause**: Supplier error, picker mistake, damage in transit
**Solution**: Verify immediately and document:

```
DELIVERY DISCREPANCY PROTOCOL:

AT DELIVERY (before driver leaves):
1. Count all items vs delivery slip
2. If discrepancy found:
   - Take photo of items + delivery slip
   - Note on delivery slip: "Received X, ordered Y"
   - Driver signs acknowledgment
   - DO NOT accept delivery as "complete"

3. Mark delivery receipt: "PARTIAL - Missing items: [list]"

SAME DAY:
4. Call supplier immediately
   - Report discrepancy
   - Reference PO # and delivery slip #
   - Request: Missing items shipped ASAP OR credit/refund

5. Email confirmation:
   - Detail discrepancy
   - Attach photos
   - Request written confirmation of resolution

RESOLUTION OPTIONS:
- Short ship: Send missing items next delivery (if not urgent)
- Rush ship: Send missing items immediately (if project-critical)
- Credit: Refund for missing items (if no longer needed)
- Return: Send back wrong items, ship correct ones

DOCUMENTATION:
Save all correspondence in: ~/Cowork-Workspace/purchasing/discrepancies/PO-[number]-issue.pdf
```

### Price increases (supplier raised prices)

**Cause**: Inflation, supplier costs up, market conditions
**Solution**: Negotiation and alternatives:

```
PRICE INCREASE RESPONSE:

Supplier notifies: "Price increasing 15% effective 02/01"

ANALYSIS:
1. Verify market conditions:
   - Are competitors raising prices too?
   - Is this industry-wide or supplier-specific?

2. Calculate impact:
   - Current annual spend with supplier: $20,000
   - 15% increase = +$3,000/year

OPTIONS:

A. NEGOTIATE:
Call supplier: "We've been loyal customers for 3 years, spending $20K/year. Can you reduce increase to 10% or grandfather us for 6 months?"

Possible outcomes:
- Partial reduction (10% instead of 15%)
- Delayed implementation (effective 04/01 instead of 02/01)
- Volume discount to offset

B. SHOP COMPETITORS:
- Get quotes from 2-3 alternative suppliers
- If better pricing available → leverage or switch

C. STOCK UP (if non-perishable):
- Pre-buy 2-3 months supply at old price before effective date
- Requires: Cash flow + storage space

D. PASS TO CUSTOMERS:
- Adjust your pricing to maintain margins
- Communicate: "Supplier costs increased, reflected in new pricing"

DECISION:
Document in supplier performance file
Adjust budget forecasts for remainder of year

Save: ~/Cowork-Workspace/purchasing/suppliers/price-change-[supplier]-[date].txt
```

### Late deliveries (impacts project schedule)

**Cause**: Supplier delays, shipping issues, stockouts
**Solution**: Proactive tracking and mitigation:

```
LATE DELIVERY MANAGEMENT:

EARLY WARNING SYSTEM:
2 days before expected delivery:
- Call supplier: "Confirming delivery still on track for [date]?"
- If delayed → activate backup plan immediately

BACKUP PLANS:

Plan A: Source from alternate supplier
- Keep list of 2-3 backup suppliers for critical items
- Call immediately: "Do you have [item] in stock? Can deliver today/tomorrow?"
- Premium pricing acceptable if prevents project delay

Plan B: Adjust project schedule
- If item not critical path → work on other tasks
- Re-sequence work to work around delay
- Example: Tile delayed → do electrical rough-in first

Plan C: Client communication
- If delay unavoidable → inform client immediately
- Honesty: "Supplier delayed, project pushed 2 days"
- Better to communicate early than surprise them

SUPPLIER ACCOUNTABILITY:
- Document all delays in supplier performance tracking
- Chronic late deliveries → reduce/eliminate usage
- Consider penalty clauses: "Late delivery = 5% discount"

```

## Variations

### Drop-shipping (direct to customer)

```
Order placed by customer, shipped by supplier directly:

WORKFLOW:
1. Customer orders from you
2. You order from supplier with customer shipping address
3. Supplier ships directly to customer
4. You pay supplier, customer pays you

BENEFITS:
- No inventory (supplier holds stock)
- No shipping logistics (supplier handles)

PO MODIFICATIONS:
SHIP TO: [Customer address] (NOT your address)
BILL TO: [Your address]

Special instructions: "Include packing slip, NO pricing info visible"

Tracking: Provide customer with tracking # from supplier
```

### Consignment ordering (supplier retains ownership until sold)

```
Supplier stocks inventory at your location, you pay only for what sells:

CONSIGNMENT AGREEMENT:
- Supplier places 50 units in your store
- You display and sell
- Monthly: Count remaining, pay for units sold
- Supplier owns unsold inventory

BENEFITS:
- Zero capital tied up
- Larger variety possible

PO STRUCTURE:
Instead of purchasing → "Consignment stock request"
Monthly reconciliation: "Sold 20 units, pay for 20"

Inventory tracking: Separate "Consigned inventory" from owned
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Consolidate orders** — Combine needs to hit free shipping thresholds and bulk discounts
2. **Early payment discounts** — 2% discount for 10-day payment = 36% annual return (take it!)
3. **Verify on delivery** — Check quantities and condition before driver leaves
4. **Track supplier performance** — Monthly scorecards identify best/worst suppliers
5. **Diversify suppliers** — Don't rely 100% on one supplier (risk mitigation)
6. **Build relationships** — Good supplier relationships = priority service, flexibility
7. **Document everything** — POs, delivery receipts, discrepancies in writing (legal protection)
8. **Forecast ahead** — Order based on upcoming needs + lead time + safety buffer
