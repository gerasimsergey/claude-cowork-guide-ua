## Use Case

You need to organize construction/project planning with milestones and coordination. This workflow helps you:

- Create detailed Gantt planning
- Coordinate work phases and contractors
- Manage material procurement
- Track progress and delays

> ⚠️ **Impact**: Good planning reduces average construction delays by 30% and budget overruns by 20%.

## Troubleshooting

### Critical path delays

**Cause**: Weather, supplier issues, inspection delays
**Solution**: Critical path management:

```
DELAY MITIGATION STRATEGIES:

1. IDENTIFY CRITICAL PATH:
Foundation → Rough inspection → Drywall → Flooring
Any delay on this path = project delay

2. FLOAT TIME UTILIZATION:
Non-critical tasks (landscaping, decorative) have float
Can be delayed without impacting completion

3. COMPRESSION TECHNIQUES:
- Add crew/resources to critical tasks
- Work overtime on critical path only
- Fast-track: Overlap phases with risk mitigation

4. RE-SEQUENCING:
If flooring delayed → do painting first if possible
Check dependencies before re-sequencing

EXAMPLE:
Rough inspection delayed 1 week (Week 10 → Week 11)
Options:
A. Accept 1-week project delay (conservative)
B. Compress drywall phase: Add 2nd crew, complete in 2 weeks instead of 3
C. Work 6-day weeks on finish phases to recover time

Decision matrix: Cost vs schedule criticality
```

### Contractor coordination conflicts

**Cause**: Multiple trades need same workspace
**Solution**: Detailed coordination:

```
TRADE COORDINATION PLAN:

CONFLICT: Electrical + Plumbing both need access Week 8

RESOLUTION:
Monday-Tuesday: Electrician (1st floor)
Wednesday-Thursday: Plumber (1st floor)
Friday: Coordination day (both trades available if issues)

Next week:
Monday-Tuesday: Electrician (2nd floor)
Wednesday-Thursday: Plumber (2nd floor)

WORKSPACE ZONING:
If same-day needed, assign different zones:
- Electrician: East wing
- Plumber: West wing

DAILY COORDINATION MEETINGS:
15-minute daily stand-up at 7:30am
Verify no conflicts for the day

LEAD TIME BUFFER:
Schedule key trades with 1-2 day buffer
Allows flexibility for coordination
```

### Material delivery timing issues

**Cause**: Supply chain delays, storage constraints
**Solution**: Procurement management:

```
MATERIAL DELIVERY STRATEGIES:

JUST-IN-TIME DELIVERY:
Minimize storage needs
Risk: Delays can halt work

EARLY DELIVERY WITH STORAGE:
Order early, store on-site
Need: Secure, weatherproof storage

HYBRID APPROACH (RECOMMENDED):
- Long lead items: Order early (6+ weeks)
- Standard items: 2-week lead time
- Perishables/timed items: Just-in-time

TRACKING SYSTEM:
| Material | Order Date | Expected | Status | Backup Plan |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Flooring | 01/15 | 03/01 | Confirmed | Expedite if late |
| Fixtures | 01/20 | 02/15 | Backorder | Alt supplier sourced |

EXPEDITING CRITERIA:
If critical path material delayed > 3 days → Expedite or substitute
```

## Variations

### Agile/iterative project planning

```
For projects with evolving scope:

2-WEEK SPRINT PLANNING:

Sprint 1 Goals:
- Complete Phase 1
- Start Phase 2

Sprint 1 Review:
- Completed: ✓
- Blockers identified: Permit delay
- Adjust Sprint 2 plan accordingly

ROLLING WAVE PLANNING:
- Detail next 4 weeks: Fully planned
- Weeks 5-8: Medium detail
- Weeks 9+: High-level only

Adapt as information becomes available
Hold weekly replanning sessions
```

### Resource-constrained scheduling

```
Limited crew availability:

CONSTRAINT: Only 1 electrician available

IMPACT:
Cannot overlap electrical rough + finish
Serial scheduling required

ADJUSTED TIMELINE:
Week 7-8: Electrical rough (all areas)
Gap: Week 9-13 (other trades)
Week 14-15: Electrical finish (all areas)

Total: Same duration but different sequencing
Must ensure other work doesn't require electrical
```

### Fast-track scheduling

```
Urgent completion needed:

NORMAL SCHEDULE: 20 weeks
FAST-TRACK TARGET: 14 weeks (30% reduction)

TECHNIQUES:
1. Overlap phases with risk management
2. Increase crew sizes (+50% labor cost)
3. Premium material shipping (expedite)
4. Overtime/weekend work
5. Pre-fabrication where possible

COST PREMIUM: +15-25% budget
RISK: Quality pressure, coordination complexity

DECISION: Fast-track only if deadline penalties > cost premium
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Critical Path Focus** — Protect critical path tasks from delays at all costs
2. **Buffer Time** — Include 10-15% contingency for unknowns
3. **Early Procurement** — Order long-lead items immediately after design approval
4. **Daily Communication** — Brief daily coordination meetings with all active trades
5. **Visual Planning** — Gantt charts, calendars visible on-site for all crews
6. **Milestone Payments** — Tie payments to deliverables, not just time
7. **Progress Photos** — Daily timestamped photos for documentation and disputes
8. **Inspection Scheduling** — Book inspections 2 weeks ahead, don't assume availability
