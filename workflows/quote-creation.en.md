## Use Case

You need to create detailed quotes for your clients. This workflow helps you:

- Create professional priced quotes
- Calculate cost basis and margins
- Generate clear technical descriptions
- Quickly adapt existing quote for new client

> ⚠️ **Important**: A quote commits your professional responsibility. Always verify prices, quantities, and deadlines before sending.

### Step 3: Add technical descriptions

For contractors/construction:

```
For each service, add:
- Detailed technical description
- Materials used (brands, references)
- Applicable standards (ASTM, local codes)
- Intervention timelines
- Warranties

Example:
"Installation of 3 PVC double-glazed windows, 4/16/4 argon,
U-value=1.3 W/m².K, energy code compliant,
white RAL 9016 finish, per local building code,
10-year warranty, 2-week lead time"
```

### Step 4: Verify and adjust

Cowork will show the plan. **Verify**:

- ✓ Correct calculations (margins included)
- ✓ Client-friendly descriptions
- ✓ Realistic deadlines
- ✓ Clear conditions

If adjustment needed:

```
Modify quote:
- Increase margin on service 2 from 25% to 30%
- Reduce deadline from 4 to 3 weeks
- Add option: [option description] +$[price]
```

### Step 5: Generate quote

```
Proceed with quote generation
```

Verify result:

```bash
open ~/Cowork-Workspace/output/quotes/Q2026-001.pdf

---

## Troubleshooting

### Margin calculation difficult

**Cause**: Cost basis poorly estimated
**Solution**: Request calculation help:

```
My material costs: $450
My labor: 8h @ $35/h
Travel expenses: $40
Overhead (20% revenue): ?
Desired margin: 25%

Calculate my selling price
```

### Descriptions too technical

**Cause**: Professional jargon
**Solution**: Adapt for client:

```
Rewrite technical descriptions in client language:
- Avoid jargon
- Explain benefits (comfort, savings, safety)
- Keep regulatory precision small print
```

### Quote too long

**Cause**: Too much detail
**Solution**: Group by lots:

```
Group services by packages:
- Package 1: Rough work (subtotal)
- Package 2: Finish work (subtotal)
- Package 3: Final details (subtotal)

Details in separate appendix
```

---

## Variations

```

PREMIUM TIER:

### Quote from previous job

- New number: Q2026-022
- New validity date

Save: ~/Cowork-Workspace/output/quotes/Q2026-022-Martin.pdf
```

### Excel summary export

```
After creating PDF quote, also generate:

With sheets:
- Cost basis (materials + labor)
- Margins per item
- Competitive comparison
- Project schedule
```

## Best Practices

1. **Unique numbering** — Continuous numbering system (Q[year]-[number])
2. **Limited validity** — Usually 3 months (state explicitly)
3. **Clear conditions** — Deposit, deadlines, payment, warranties
4. **Photos if helpful** — Include site photos for renovation quotes
5. **Versions** — Keep history if quote modified (v1, v2, etc.)
6. **Proofreading** — Have third party review if large amount
7. **Follow-up timing** — Follow up with client after 1 week if no response
8. **Quote = commitment** — Prices and services locked unless noted otherwise
