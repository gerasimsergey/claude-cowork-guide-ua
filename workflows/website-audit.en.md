## Use Case

Your website is often a prospect's first impression. This workflow helps you:

- Identify critical issues on your business website
- Verify essential information is visible
- Improve conversion (visitor → contact)
- Benchmark against local competition

> ⚠️ **Cowork limitation**: Cowork can browse your site via the built-in browser, but cannot truly test mobile. Mobile audit is based on visual analysis.

## Troubleshooting

### Cowork cannot access the site

**Cause**: Blocked site, SSL issue, or site offline
**Solution**: Verify site is accessible in a normal browser:

```
The site [URL] seems inaccessible.

Check:
1. Is the URL correct? (no spaces, https://)
2. Does the site respond? (test in browser)
3. Is there a redirect? (www vs non-www)

If the site works in your browser but not in Cowork,
it's probably a temporary block. Try again in a few minutes.
```

### Audit too superficial

**Cause**: Prompt too vague
**Solution**: Request specific points:

```
Analyze the "Contact" section of [URL] in more detail:

- Is the form functional? (fields, submit button)
- Are required fields clear?
- Is there a confirmation message after submission?
- Is response time mentioned?
- Is the phone number in clickable format (tel:)?
```

### How to compare with competitors without knowing their URLs

```
Find my 3 main local competitors:

My business: [your trade]
My city: [city]

Google search: "[trade] [city]"

List the first 3 results (excluding ads):
1. [Name] - [URL]
2. [Name] - [URL]
3. [Name] - [URL]

Then run the comparative benchmark.
```

## Best Practices

1. **Audit regularly** — At least once per quarter
2. **Test on mobile** — 60%+ of visits are mobile (ask someone to test)
3. **Verify your info** — Phone, hours, address must be current
4. **Respond to reviews** — Google favors businesses that respond
5. **Benchmark yourself** — Your competitors improve, so should you
6. **Prioritize** — Fix what blocks contact first (phone, form)
7. **Measure** — Before/after each improvement, note results
8. **Get feedback** — Your customers are the best testers

## Limitations

| What Cowork can do | What Cowork cannot do |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Browse the site | Actually test on mobile |
| Read visible content | Access complete source code |
| Analyze structure | Measure real performance (exact load time) |
| Compare visually | Test forms (actual submission) |
| Identify obvious issues | Deep technical SEO audit |

**For a complete technical audit**, use specialized tools:
- PageSpeed Insights (Google) — performance
- GTmetrix — speed
- Google Search Console — SEO
- Mobile-Friendly Test (Google) — mobile compatibility
