## Troubleshooting

### Contradictory information

**Cause**: Multiple sources, outdated data
**Solution**: Source hierarchy:

```
RELIABILITY HIERARCHY (most to least reliable):

1. OFFICIAL LEGAL (100% reliable):
   - State business registry
   - Official business announcements
   → Source of truth for: Tax ID, official address, officers

2. SEMI-OFFICIAL (95% reliable):
   - Commercial databases (D&B, Bloomberg)
   - Verified LinkedIn company page
   → Reliable for: Revenue, employee count, contacts

3. SELF-DECLARED (70% reliable):
   - Company website (self-reported)
   - Individual LinkedIn profiles
   → May be outdated or embellished

4. EXTERNAL (50% reliable):
   - Customer reviews (subjective)
   - Press articles (sometimes sponsored)
   → Useful for trends, not factual data

EXAMPLE CONFLICT:
- Official registry: 25 employees
- LinkedIn: "50-100 employees"
- Website: "Over 100 team members"

→ Trust registry (25) as official
→ Marketing may exaggerate (website)
```

### Prospect not found

**Cause**: Small business, no web presence
**Solution**: Alternative sources:

```
Prospect "Martin Plumbing" → No website, no LinkedIn

ALTERNATIVE SOURCES:

1. Professional directories:
   - Yellow Pages
   - Chamber of Commerce (business directory)
   - Trade association directories

2. Local social networks:
   - Local Facebook groups
   - Nextdoor (neighborhood network)

3. Field research:
   - Google Street View (see storefront, location size)
   - Drive by (discreet)

4. Network:
   - Ask colleagues who know them
   - Common potential clients

5. Direct contact:
   - Phone call (Yellow Pages)
   - Direct qualification by phone:
     "Hello, I'm looking to see if you have project X
      to propose solution Y. How many employees?
      What budget range?"

For small businesses without web: Direct contact often more effective than research
```

## Variations

### Automated competitive intelligence

```
Set up Google Alerts for target prospects:

ALERT 1: "[Company name]"
Frequency: Weekly
→ Detects: Press articles, announcements, news

ALERT 2: "[Company name] + hiring"
→ Detects: Job postings = growth signal

ALERT 3: "[Company name] + RFP"
→ Detects: Public tenders, opportunities

Alert compilation:
Every Monday, check Google Alert emails
If interesting info: Update prospect file + sales follow-up
```

### CRM integration

```
Structure prospect data for CRM import:

CSV compatible format:
| Company | Tax ID | Contact | Email | Phone | Revenue | Employees | Score | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|-------|---------|-----------|-------|--------|-------|

Import into:
- HubSpot (free up to 1000 contacts)
- Pipedrive
- Zoho CRM

Advantages vs. Excel:
- Automated follow-ups
- Interaction history
- Statistical reporting
```

## Best Practices

1. **Qualify BEFORE contact** — 15 min research saves 2h useless outreach
2. **Official sources priority** — Use government registries for legal data
3. **Regular updates** — Re-qualify prospects every 6 months
4. **GDPR/privacy compliance** — Only store public professional data
5. **Systematic personalization** — Use research in commercial approach
6. **Objective scoring** — Scoring grid avoids emotional bias
7. **Traceable documentation** — Archive sources and research dates
8. **Time ROI** — Deepen research proportionally to potential deal size
