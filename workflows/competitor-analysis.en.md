Format: Comparative grid
Save: ~/Cowork-Workspace/intelligence/competition/digital-analysis.xlsx
```

### Step 3: Offer and price comparison

Analyze commercial positioning:

```
Offer comparison for: [Industry]

PRICE COLLECTION METHOD:

1. MYSTERY SHOPPER (ethical):

   - Collect 3-5 competitive quotes

2. PUBLIC PRICING:
   - Websites (if displayed)
   - Brochures/catalogs

|---------|-----|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| Emergency service | $80 | $95 | $75 | $90 | $85 |
| Outlet installation | $45 | $50 | $40 | $55 | $48 |

Competitor B (cheaper):
- Possible lower quality?
- Check reviews: Satisfied despite low price?

ME:
- My strengths vs competition: [Ex: Certified, responsiveness, experience]
- My weaknesses: [Ex: No weekend service, limited area]

DIFFERENTIATION OPPORTUNITIES:
- Untapped niche: [Ex: Home automation specialization]
- Missing service: [Ex: No one offers preventive maintenance]

### Step 4: Strengths/weaknesses analysis

Competitive SWOT matrix:

✓ Google rating 4.5/5 = satisfaction
✓ Physical showroom = customer trust

Competitor B:

✓ Responsiveness (response <2h per reviews)
✓ Strong social media presence

COMPETITOR WEAKNESSES:
Competitor A:
✗ Outdated website (not mobile-responsive)
✗ No social networks (aging)
✗ Recent reviews mention "expensive"
✗ Delays (order backlog)

vs generalist competitors

Implementation:

AXIS 3: PRICE/VALUE

## Troubleshooting

### Too many competitors

**Cause**: Saturated market
**Solution**: Focus on top competitors:

```
Area with 25+ competitors → Impossible to analyze all

PRIORITIZATION (Top 5):
1. Competitor with highest estimated market share
2. Competitor with best Google rating
3. Geographically closest competitor
4. Competitor with most similar offering
5. Competitor with most aggressive communication

Analyze these 5 in depth
Monitor remaining 20 in passive watch (Google Alerts)
```

### Inaccessible competitor data

**Cause**: No web presence, opacity
**Solution**: Field sources:

```
Competitor without site/networks:

ALTERNATIVE METHODS:
1. Mystery shopper phone call:
   - Call for quote
   - Note: Reception, responsiveness, price, professionalism

2. Physical observation:
   - Visit location (size, clientele, activity)
   - Google Street View (evolution over time)

3. Professional network:
   - Ask colleagues (carefully)
   - Common suppliers (purchase volumes)

4. Word-of-mouth reviews:
   - Local forums
   - Neighborhood Facebook groups
```

### Local Visibility Audit (Google My Business)

Compare your local presence against the competition:

```
Local visibility audit - Google My Business:

MY SEARCH: "[my trade] [my city]"
Example: "plumber Chicago"

ANALYZE TOP 5 RESULTS (excluding ads):

For each competitor (+ myself):
══════════════════════════════════════

COMPETITOR 1: [Name]
Google My Business:
- Average rating: ⭐ X.X/5
- Number of reviews: X reviews
- Latest review: [date]
- Photos: X photos (recent? professional?)
- Hours listed: YES/NO
- Services listed: YES/NO
- Responds to reviews: YES/NO (response ratio)
- Website linked: YES/NO
- Main category: [...]

Local Pack Position: #X (on Maps)

══════════════════════════════════════

ME: [My business]
[Same criteria]

══════════════════════════════════════

COMPARISON TABLE:

| Criteria | Me | Competitor 1 | Competitor 2 | Competitor 3 |
|----------|-----|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Rating /5 | | | | |
| # Reviews | | | | |
| Review freshness | | | | |
| # Photos | | | | |
| Responds to reviews | | | | |
| Maps position | | | | |

DIAGNOSIS:

If lower rating:
→ Review collection plan (see Review Response workflow)

If fewer reviews:
→ Ask systematically after every job

If insufficient photos:
→ Job site photo routine (1 before/after per week)

If not responding to reviews:
→ Respond to 100% of reviews (positive AND negative)

If weak Maps position:
→ Optimize listing (categories, services, hours, photos)

LOCAL VISIBILITY ACTION PLAN:

Week 1-2: [Urgent actions]
Month 1: [Important actions]
Quarter: [Review/photo targets]

Save: ~/Cowork-Workspace/intelligence/competition/local-visibility-audit-[date].pdf
```

### Simplified Local SEO Benchmark

```
Compare Google positioning (organic search):

KEYWORDS TO TEST (Google search):
1. "[trade] + [city]" (e.g., "electrician Boston")
2. "[trade] + [neighborhood]" (e.g., "plumber Back Bay")
3. "[specific service] + [city]" (e.g., "boiler repair NYC")
4. "[trade] + emergency + [city]" (e.g., "locksmith emergency LA")

FOR EACH SEARCH:

Organic position (page 1 = top 10):
- My site: Position #X (or "Not found on page 1")
- Competitor 1: Position #X
- Competitor 2: Position #X
- Competitor 3: Position #X

SUMMARY TABLE:

| Keyword | Me | C1 | C2 | C3 | Est. Volume |
|---------|-----|----|----|----| ------------|
| [trade city] | #? | | | | High |
| [trade neighborhood] | #? | | | | Medium |
| [service city] | #? | | | | Medium |
| [emergency city] | #? | | | | Low but lucrative |

ANALYSIS:
- Keywords where I rank well: [...]
- Keywords where I'm absent: [...]
- Opportunities (low competition): [...]

BASIC SEO ACTIONS (no expert needed):
1. Page titles = "[Service] [City] - [Business name]"
2. Text = mention city/neighborhood naturally
3. Google My Business = optimize 100%
4. Google reviews = more reviews = better local ranking

Save: ~/Cowork-Workspace/intelligence/competition/local-seo-benchmark-[date].xlsx
```

### National sector benchmark

```
Compare performance vs national averages:

SECTOR STATS SOURCES:
- Government statistics (industry data)
- Professional associations
- Industry observatories
- Market research firms

INDICATORS:
- Average revenue per employee: $[X]
  → Me: $[Y] (above/below average)

- Average net margin: [Z]%
  → Me: [W]% (positioning)

- Sector growth rate: [+X%/year]
  → Me: [+Y%] (outperformance/underperformance)

OBJECTIVE: Identify if problem is local (competition) or global (skills, management)

If performance < national average despite little local competition
→ Internal problem (pricing, quality, marketing) not competition
```

## Best Practices

1. **Continuous monitoring** — Not one-time, track changes (quarterly minimum)
2. **Ethics** — No disparagement, illegal espionage, defamation
3. **Focus differentiation** — Objective isn't to copy but stand out
4. **Customer-centric** — Analyze competition to better serve customers (not obsession)
5. **Possible collaboration** — Some competitors = future partners (subcontracting, complementary specializations)
6. **Positive benchmarking** — Inspired by best practices (not just criticize weaknesses)
7. **Action > Analysis** — Monitoring useful IF leads to concrete actions
8. **Measure impact** — Track if differentiation actions work (KPIs)
