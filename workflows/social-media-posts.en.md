Save: ~/Cowork-Workspace/social-media/calendar/jan-2026-calendar.xlsx
```

### Step 4: Write engaging copy

Copywriting techniques:

```
Social media copywriting best practices:

HOOK (First Line):
Grab attention in first 1-2 lines (before "see more"):

✓ Question: "Ever wondered why your electric bill is so high?"
✓ Bold statement: "We just saved a client $2,000 on their renovation."
✓ Surprise: "This kitchen cost LESS than you think. 👇"
✓ Emotion: "The look on her face when she saw the finished room..."

✗ Avoid: "We are pleased to announce..." (boring)
✗ Avoid: "Click here to learn more" (no context)

STRUCTURE:

1. Hook (1-2 lines)
2. Value/Story (2-4 lines)
3. Call-to-action (1 line)
4. Contact info (optional)
5. Hashtags (end)

EXAMPLE:

Your electrical panel is older than your car. 🚗⚡

Here's why that matters: Panels from the '80s weren't designed for today's appliances. Overloaded circuits = fire risk + constant breaker trips.

We replace 5-10 outdated panels every month. Most jobs take 1 day, cost $1,200-1,800.

Is your panel overdue for an upgrade? Free assessment: (555) 123-4567

Example: "Crushed this kitchen reno! 🔨 3 weeks, zero delays. That's how we roll. Your dream space is next! 💪 DM us!"

──────────────────────────────────────

CALL-TO-ACTION (CTA):

Weak CTAs:
✗ "Let us know if you need help"
✗ "Contact us for more information"

Strong CTAs:
✓ "Call today for free quote: (555) 123-4567"
✓ "Book your free consultation: [link]"
✓ "DM us your project idea!"

## Troubleshooting

### Low engagement (few likes/comments)

**Cause**: Boring content, poor timing, or wrong audience
**Solution**: Content audit and adjustment:

```
ENGAGEMENT BOOST TACTICS:

1. USE MORE VISUALS:
- Posts with images: 2.3× more engagement than text-only
- Videos: 3× more engagement than images
- Before/afters: Extremely high engagement

2. ASK QUESTIONS:
Instead of: "We installed a new HVAC system today."
Try: "Central AC or ductless mini-splits? What would YOU choose?"
(Questions get 2× more comments)

3. TELL STORIES:
Instead of: "Completed kitchen renovation."
Try: "Mrs. Johnson waited 15 years for this kitchen. When she walked in and cried happy tears, we knew we nailed it. Here's her story..."
(Stories create emotional connection)

4. POST AT BETTER TIMES:
Test different times for 2 weeks:
- Week 1: Post at 9 AM
- Week 2: Post at 12 PM
Compare engagement, stick with winner

5. USE TRENDING HASHTAGS:
Research what's trending in your industry:
#TransformationTuesday, #BeforeAndAfterFriday
Ride the trend wave (higher visibility)
```

## Variations

### Video content (higher engagement)

```

1. TIME-LAPSE:
   - Set up phone on tripod
   - Record 8-hour workday
   - Speed up to 30 seconds
   - Add text overlay + music
   - Engagement: 3× higher than photos

2. TALKING HEAD (Educational):
   - 30-60 second tip
   - You explaining something
   - Captions required (80% watch muted)
   - Example: "Here's why your breaker keeps tripping..."

3. PROCESS VIDEO:

   - Step-by-step
   - Satisfying to watch
   - Example: Tile installation process

TOOLS:

```

### User-generated content (UGC)

```
Encourage customers to post about your work:

STRATEGY:
1. Ask permission to repost client photos
2. Create branded hashtag: #[YourBusinessName]Builds
3. Offer incentive: "Post your project, tag us, get 10% off next service"

REPOST WITH CREDIT:

Original: Client posts photo of their new kitchen
You repost:
"📸 @ClientUsername loving their new kitchen!

Thanks for trusting us with your project!

Want to be featured? Use #JohnsElectricWorks and tag us!"

Benefit: Authentic social proof > your own photos
```

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency over perfection** — Regular imperfect posts > sporadic perfect ones
2. **Visual quality matters** — Clear, well-lit photos (phone camera fine, just good lighting)
3. **Engage back** — Reply to all comments within 24 hours (builds community)
4. **Authenticity wins** — Real team photos > stock images
5. **80/20 rule** — 80% value/entertainment, 20% promotion (not all sales pitches)
6. **Platform-specific** — Don't copy-paste same post to all platforms (adapt each one)
7. **Track what works** — Double down on content that gets high engagement
8. **Batch create** — Write multiple posts at once (save time, maintain consistency)
