```
How to use templates (30 seconds per email):

METHOD 1: MANUAL (Copy-Paste)

1. Open template file
2. Copy template text
3. Paste into email
4. Find-Replace all variables:
   - [CLIENT_NAME] → John Smith
   - [SERVICE] → Electrical panel upgrade

\"\"\"

Time: 20 seconds + review

Save method: ~/Cowork-Workspace/email-templates/usage-guide.txt
```

### Step 4: Track template effectiveness

Monitor performance:

```
Email template performance tracking:

METRICS TO TRACK:

Template: Appointment Confirmation
- Sent: 45 times (January)
- Response rate: N/A (confirmation, not expecting reply)
- Cancellations after sending: 2 (4%)
- Goal: <5% cancellations ✓

Template: Quote Follow-Up
- Sent: 23 times
- Response rate: 15 replies (65%)
- Converted to jobs: 8 (35% conversion)
- Goal: 30%+ conversion ✓
- Observation: Follow-up increases conversion by 25% vs no follow-up

Template: Payment Reminder (Gentle)
- Sent: 18 times
- Paid within 7 days: 14 (78%)
- Needed 2nd reminder: 4 (22%)
- Goal: >75% pay after first reminder ✓

Template: Thank You (After Service)
- Sent: 38 times
- Reviews received: 12 (32%)
- Goal: 25%+ review rate ✓
- Observation: Including review link essential

OPTIMIZATION:

If response rate low:
- Test different subject lines (A/B test)
- Adjust tone (more casual vs formal)
- Change timing (send morning vs afternoon)

If conversion low:
- Add urgency ("Quote expires in 7 days")
- Include social proof ("Join 500+ satisfied customers")
- Clarify next steps ("Reply YES to schedule")

If template not used:
- Too complex (simplify)
- Situation too rare (archive, don't maintain)
- Better handled by phone call

Save metrics: ~/Cowork-Workspace/email-templates/performance-jan-2026.xlsx
```

### Step 5: Maintain and improve

Regular updates:

```
Template maintenance schedule:

MONTHLY REVIEW (15 minutes):

1. Check template usage:
   - Which templates used most? (keep optimized)
   - Which templates never used? (archive or delete)

2. Update outdated info:
   - Phone numbers changed?
   - Pricing updated?
   - Service offerings changed?
   - Seasonal promotions expired?

3. Refine based on feedback:
   - Client confused by email? (clarify wording)
   - Client asked same question repeatedly? (add to template)
   - Tone off? (adjust)

QUARTERLY DEEP DIVE (1 hour):

1. Analyze metrics:
   - Which templates have best conversion?
   - Where are clients dropping off?

2. Create new templates:
   - New service added? (create introduction email)
   - New common scenario? (template it)

3. A/B test variations:
   - Try 2 versions of same template
   - Track which performs better
   - Keep winner

Example A/B test:

Subject A: "Your quote for [SERVICE]"
Subject B: "Here's your custom [SERVICE] quote"

Send A to 50% of clients, B to 50%
Track open rates over 2 weeks
Winner: Subject B (38% open vs 24% for A)

Update template with winning version

VERSION CONTROL:

Template: Quote Follow-Up
Version 1.0 (Jan 2026): Original
Version 1.1 (Feb 2026): Added urgency ("Quote expires in...")
Version 1.2 (Mar 2026): Changed subject line (A/B test winner)

Keep changelog: ~/Cowork-Workspace/email-templates/changelog.txt

Save: ~/Cowork-Workspace/email-templates/maintenance-log.txt
```

## Automated Sequences

### Quote Follow-Up Sequence (4 emails)

The highest-ROI sequence for small businesses: systematically follow up on unanswered quotes.

**Reality check**: An unfollowed quote = 60-80% lost opportunity. A structured sequence recovers 20-30% of "lost" quotes.

```
Create complete quote follow-up sequence:

CONTEXT: Small business/tradesperson sending quotes and wanting to maximize conversion

4-EMAIL SEQUENCE:

EMAIL 1 - Day 0 (Initial send)
Objective: Accompany the quote, create soft urgency
Tone: Professional, enthusiastic
Structure:
- Thank them for the inquiry
- Quote attached (summary: [amount], [validity])
- Available for questions
- CTA: "Reply to this email to confirm"

EMAIL 2 - Day 3 (Soft follow-up)
Objective: Verify receipt, address objections
Tone: Helpful, not salesy
Structure:
- "Did you receive my quote?"
- Offer to clarify any points
- CTA: "Questions? I'll call you back"

EMAIL 3 - Day 7 (Deadline reminder)
Objective: Create urgency, offer alternative
Tone: Direct but friendly
Structure:
- Reminder quote expires [date]
- Calendar filling up ("limited slots this month")
- Option B if budget is tight
- CTA: "Confirm by [date] to lock in the schedule"

EMAIL 4 - Day 14 (Final follow-up)
Objective: Close professionally, keep door open
Tone: Professional, no resentment
Structure:
- "I'm closing this file unless I hear back"
- No reproach
- Invitation to reconnect later
- CTA: "Feel free to reach out anytime"

Variables for all:
- [client_name]
- [project_description]
- [quote_amount]
- [quote_number]
- [expiration_date]
- [your_name]

Format: 4 separate files
Save: ~/Cowork-Workspace/email-templates/quote-followup-sequence/
```

### Using the sequence

**Option 1: Manual (calendar reminders)**

```
I sent a quote to [client name] on [date].

Set up reminders for me:
- Day 3: Soft follow-up
- Day 7: Deadline reminder
- Day 14: Final close

For each reminder, prepare personalized email ready to copy
based on templates in ~/Cowork-Workspace/email-templates/quote-followup-sequence/
```

**Option 2: Tracking spreadsheet**

```
Create Excel quote follow-up tracker:

Columns:
- Quote number
- Client
- Amount
- Date sent
- Status (Pending / Followed D+3 / Followed D+7 / Closed / Accepted / Declined)
- Next action
- Next action date
- Notes

Formulas:
- Red conditional formatting if date overdue
- Conversion rate calculation

Save: ~/Cowork-Workspace/output/quote-followup-tracker.xlsx
```

### Dormant Client Reactivation Sequence

For clients with no order in 6+ months:

```
Create dormant client reactivation sequence (3 emails):

EMAIL 1 - "Checking in"
Objective: Reconnect without selling
Tone: Personal, genuine
- "It's been a while..."
- Ask about their projects
- No commercial CTA

EMAIL 2 (Day 7) - "News/offer"
Objective: Give reason to return
Tone: Informative
- New service/equipment/capability
- "Loyal customer" promo if applicable
- CTA: "Interested? Reply to this email"

EMAIL 3 (Day 14) - "Last chance"
Objective: Limited offer + close
Tone: Direct
- Recap offer
- Limited validity
- "If I don't hear back, I'll assume timing isn't right"

Variables:
- [client_first_name]
- [last_service] (description + date)
- [special_offer]
- [deadline]

Save: ~/Cowork-Workspace/email-templates/reactivation-sequence/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Templates feel impersonal (robotic)

**Cause**: Too generic, obvious copy-paste
**Solution**: Add personal touches:

```
MAKE TEMPLATES FEEL PERSONAL:

1. REFERENCE SPECIFIC DETAILS:

Generic:
"Thank you for choosing us for your project."

Personal:
"Thank you for trusting us with your beautiful kitchen renovation. The new backsplash tile you picked really ties the room together!"

2. USE CLIENT'S WORDS:

If client said "Our panel is ancient":
"Following up on the panel upgrade you mentioned was 'ancient' :)"

3. ADD CUSTOM LINE:

Template body (standardized)
+
1-2 sentence custom note at top:
"Sarah, great meeting you last week! Here's the quote we discussed..."

4. VARY GREETINGS:

Don't always use "Hi [NAME],"

Options:
- "Hope you're doing well, [NAME]!"
- "[NAME], thanks for reaching out!"
- "Great to hear from you, [NAME]!"

Rotate based on relationship/context
```

### Too many templates to manage

**Cause**: Over-created, too specific
**Solution**: Consolidate and simplify:

```
TEMPLATE CONSOLIDATION:

Before (8 separate templates):
- Quote follow-up (1 week after)
- Quote follow-up (2 weeks after)
- Quote follow-up (3 weeks after)
- Quote follow-up (before expiration)

After (1 flexible template):
- Quote follow-up (adjust timeline variable)

Use one template with conditional sections:

Template: Quote Follow-Up
Timeline: [DAYS_SINCE_QUOTE]

If 1 week: "Just wanted to check in..."
If 2 weeks: "Wanted to follow up again..."
If 3 weeks: "Your quote expires soon..."

Keep templates <20 total for manageability
```

### Variables confusing to fill

**Cause**: Too many variables, unclear names
**Solution**: Simplify and clarify:

```
VARIABLE BEST PRACTICES:

Bad variable names:
[VAR1], [VAR2], [XXX], [PLACEHOLDER]

Good variable names:
[CLIENT_FIRST_NAME], [SERVICE_TYPE], [APPOINTMENT_DATE]

Reduce variables:

Before (10 variables):
[CLIENT_FIRST_NAME], [CLIENT_LAST_NAME], [COMPANY_NAME], [STREET], [CITY], [STATE], [ZIP], ...

After (3 variables):
[CLIENT_NAME] - Use first name only
[ADDRESS] - Full address as one field
[CONTACT_INFO] - Phone/email together

Trade-off: Less customization, more usability

Provide variable list at top:

---
Required variables:
[CLIENT_NAME] = Client first name
[SERVICE] = What you're providing
[DATE] = Appointment/service date
[AMOUNT] = Price (with $ symbol)
---

Copy-paste helper sheet:
~/Cowork-Workspace/email-templates/variable-sheet-blank.txt

Fill it out once, copy-paste values into template
```

---

## Variations

### Multi-language templates

```
Create templates in multiple languages:

Structure:
/email-templates/
  /english/
    appointment-confirmation.txt
    quote-followup.txt
  /spanish/
    appointment-confirmation.txt
    quote-followup.txt

Spanish example:

Subject: Confirmación: Cita de [SERVICIO] el [FECHA] a las [HORA]

Hola [NOMBRE_CLIENTE],

Esto confirma su cita para [SERVICIO] el [FECHA] a las [HORA].

[...continue in Spanish]

Use for: Areas with bilingual clientele
```

### Template chains (automated sequences)

```
Sequence of related templates:

SEQUENCE: New Customer Onboarding

Email 1 (Day 0): Welcome email
Email 2 (Day 3): How to get the most from our service
Email 3 (Day 7): Check-in (any questions?)
Email 4 (Day 30): Request review

Each builds on previous, guides customer journey

Track where they are in sequence:
~/Cowork-Workspace/email-templates/sequences/tracking.xlsx

Customer: John Smith
Sequence: Onboarding
Current step: Email 2 (sent 01/18)
Next: Email 3 (send 01/22)
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Start with 5-10 templates** — Cover most common emails, expand as needed
2. **One template per file** — Easier to find and update
3. **Version templates** — Track changes, know what's current
4. **Test before mass use** — Send to yourself first, check formatting
5. **Mobile-friendly** — Keep paragraphs short (reads well on phone)
6. **Clear subject lines** — Recipient should know what email is about before opening
7. **Review quarterly** — Delete unused, update outdated
8. **Back up library** — Cloud storage so you never lose templates
